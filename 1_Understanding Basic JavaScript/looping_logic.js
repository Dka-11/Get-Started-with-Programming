/*
Looping with For

example :

for(let i=0; i<5; i++){
    console.log("Hello World");
}

consoles . log ( "Already outside the for condition" );

initial value by int = 0, 
increment the value untill i less than 5,
then after condition i is equal to 5, exit loop
so it will print statements that are outside the looping code, namely "already ...."
*/

/*

Looping with while

let counter = 0;

while(counter < 5){
    console.log("Hello World");
    counter++;
}

consoles . log ( "Already outside the while condition" );
